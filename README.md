# FE-2023-examples
Example scripts for 2023 faculty enrichment program in applied malaria modeling at Northwestern

### Technical track (EMOD)

**Overview**: 
Exercises usually consist of a simulation and an analyzer of simulation outputs. 
In some weeks, additional scripts exist to prepare simulation inputs or generate additional outputs and plots, or for model calibration as described in the instructions for the respective weeks.

**Checking results:**
For each week suggested simulation scripts for comparison or help during the exercise are provided in the folder [Solution_scripts](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/faculty-enrich-2022-examples/tree/main/Solution_scripts).

**Prerequisites**: 
Before running the weekly example scripts, please ensure that emodpy has been successfully [installed]((https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/install-emod/))
and that the [repository has been cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
to your local computer, ideally under _/<.username>/Documents/FE-23-examples_.
Running your scripts will require that the emodpy virtual environment is loaded and assumes files are run from a working directory set to where the script is located.
